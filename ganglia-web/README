This is an attempt to make the Ganglia UI more usable. You should be able to drop this into
your $HTTPD_ROOT/ganglia then run make to generate conf_default.php. make install will
create all the 

Configuration
=============

All the configuration options are in conf_default.php. You can override any of the values by
creating and editing conf.php. If you want to use standard directories such as 

/var/lib/ganglia/rrds for RRDs

and

/var/lib/ganglia/dwoo

for DWOO (templating engine) compiled templates you don't need to do anything. If however you
want to change it create a conf.php like this

<?php

$conf['rrds'] = "/my/rrds";
$conf['dwoo_compiled_dir'] = "/my/dwoo";

?>

This will make the upgrade process much easier since upgrade will not clobber your custom
conf.php.

New features
============

Views
=====

Views are an arbitrary collection of hostname/metric graphs. They are defined using JSON files and stored in the
/conf directory. View file names have to start with view ie.

view_web_servers_vitals.json

There are two types of views, standard (default) and regex views. 

Standard views are defined as follows

{"view_name":"web_servers_vitals",
  "items": [
    { "hostname":"web1", "metric":"disk_free"},
    { "hostname":"web2", "graph":"cpu_report"}
          ]
}

Regex views allow using regex to match hostnames (need to specify view_type regex) e.g.

{"view_name":"web_servers_wiki",
 "view_type":"regex",
  "items": [
    { "hostname":"web-wiki.*", "metric":"disk_free"},
    { "hostname":".*wiki", "graph":"cpu_report"}
          ]
}

Obviously you can write a regex that matches a single host. 

Auto Rotation
=============

Automatically rotate view graphs every 30 seconds with hour, day, week and month overview for each metric
on a single page. It will rotate until page closed. 

Optional Graphs
===============

Ability to define optional graphs that are show at the top of the page for any host.
Those are defined using overrides stored in $GANGLIA_DIR/conf directory. You need
to make sure that directory is writeable by the Apache/Web user.

This should work like the normal Ganglia web UI. The difference is that
you need to make the conf/ directory writeable by the Apache user.

Search
======

You can search for a metric or a host in a live manner. You should be able to click on the
host or metric in the search and 

Installation notes
==================

IMPORTANT:
You will need PHP JSON extension. It comes with PHP 5.2+. If you are on 5.1
use 

pecl install json

pecl is part of php-pear package on RHEL/CentOS. Make sure you have 

# cat /etc/php.d/json.ini 
extension=json.so

On RHEL/CentOS 4, you will also need phpize which comes with the php-devel package.

The web directory should also have "AllowOverride all" specified in your httpd.conf file, otherwise the API URL simplification will not work as advertised.

BUGS
====

In the search window when you click on a metric it should actually jump to the metric once the
page is opened. That doesn't work. If you just press enter in the Location bar it does jump.
